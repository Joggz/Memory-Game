# How I built the Memory Game

### I manipulated the DOM  with Vanilla JS, added and altered part of the HTML and did some styling.

- created the board for the cards
- created  a deck of cards that shuffles when the game is refreshed
- created a counter for the number of move made by the player and also a timer which starts counting on the first move
- added a match and unmatch function which determine if the flipped cards remains opens or not;
- create a pop-up modal when player wins the game.
